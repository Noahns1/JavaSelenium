### What Is My Project?
This project is part of a twin set of projects that achieve identical functionality. In this project, Java, Maven, Selenium, TestNG, and Cucumber are utilized for Behavior-driven development (BDD) to automate test cases on Amazon. Its twin project achieves the same test cases but implements Python, Selenium, and Behave.

### Why Is This Project Useful?
I developed this project to showcase not only my proficiency in test case creation and automation but also demonstrate my adeptness in both Python and Java. Regardless of the language used, the project accomplishes the same functionality, highlighting my versatility and understanding of different programming languages.

### Scenarios
In this project, I've implemented four scenarios that are identical to those in the twin project. The only distinction is that those have been converted to Python for implementation.

These Scenarios are:

1. Test drive webdriver
     - This is a "test drive" scenario to validate the functionality of Behave and Selenium installations.
2. Amazon - Find Selenium book and add to cart
     - This scenario focuses on searching for an item, selecting it, adding it to the cart, and then validating its presence in the cart.
3. Amazon - Incorrectly attempt to create an account
     - This scenario concentrates on negative testing by simulating errors that arise when incorrect input information is provided for creating an account.
4. Amazon - Validate text on item
     - This scenario's focus is on validating text on a specific item selected, such as it's Title, Author, Description and preface.
